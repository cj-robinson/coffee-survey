### Overview/Findings
--
James Hoffmann’s “Great American Taste Test” surveyed over 4,000 participants to explore how demographic factors influence coffee preferences. The study examined ratings of four coffee blends, including an experimental fermented coffee (Coffee D), and found significant variations across gender, self-reported expertise, and age.

- Gender Differences: Women rated Coffee D nearly 20% lower than men and non-binary participants, potentially due to differences in taste perception.
- Expertise Influence: Higher self-rated coffee expertise correlated with a stronger preference for Coffee D, particularly among men.
Age & Taste Shifts: Younger participants and those aged 35–44 showed the highest preference for Coffee D, while older respondents preferred traditional dark roasts.
- Survey Context: The sample consisted mainly of Hoffmann’s audience, making it a specialized rather than generalizable study. However, with over 4,000 responses, it provides rare insight into demographic-driven taste preferences.
